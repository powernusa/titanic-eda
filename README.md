# 🛳️ Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

> **Status:** Work in progress — actively updated as I build my data analysis portfolio.  
> Target completion: December 2025.

This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the classic **Titanic dataset** — one of the most iconic datasets in data science.

Although _Titanic_ is often treated as a “hello world” project, the dataset is **not trivial**.  
It contains:

- mixed data types
- categorical variables
- missing values
- interaction effects
- subtle correlations
- multiple modeling possibilities

This makes Titanic **an excellent dataset for learning practical EDA**, especially for building strong intuition around:

- data cleaning & wrangling
- analyzing categorical vs numerical features
- handling missing values
- building distributions
- visual storytelling
- generating data-driven hypotheses
